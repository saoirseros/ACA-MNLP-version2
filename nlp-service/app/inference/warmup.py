"""
Optional model warm-up.

Since every chat message now runs through the combined /analyze/message
pipeline (Adaptive Context Activation + sentiment + emotion + toxicity),
it's worth paying the one-time model-loading cost right after the service
starts rather than on the first real chat message. This runs in a
background thread so /health stays responsive immediately, even while
warm-up is still in progress.
