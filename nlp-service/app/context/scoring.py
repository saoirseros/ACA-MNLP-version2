"""
Adaptive Context Activation: interpretable context-requirement scoring.

Combines a handful of simple, explainable signals into a single "context
requirement score" in [0, 1], then buckets it into low/medium/high. This
is a deliberately simple first implementation per the project spec ("do
not make this mathematically unnecessarily complicated"); the weights and
thresholds below are heuristic starting points, not tuned from data -
that tuning is exactly what the Phase 9 experiment framework is for.
